# SDC AWS Pipeline Architecture

This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing AWS infrastructure across multiple missions, with separate environments for development and production.

## Infrastructure Management

### Base Infrastructure
- Managed in `base-infrastructure-terraform/`
- Uses default Terraform workspace
- Contains shared resources used across all pipelines
- Key components:
  - Base AWS infrastructure setup
  - Executor Lambda function
  - Common configuration in `swxsoc.auto.tfvars`

### Pipeline Infrastructure
- Managed in `pipeline-infrastructure-terraform/`
- Uses separate workspaces for each mission's environments
- Two workspaces per mission: development (dev) and production (prod)
- Components:
  - Mission-specific configurations (`hermes.tfvars`, `padre.tfvars`)
  - Lambda functions for artifacts, processing, and sorting
  - Pipeline-specific infrastructure

## Getting Started

1. Install prerequisites:
   - Terraform
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

2. Base Infrastructure Deployment:
```bash
cd base-infrastructure-terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

3. Pipeline Infrastructure Deployment:
```bash
cd pipeline-infrastructure-terraform
terraform workspace select <environment>-<mission>
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=<mission>.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=<mission>.tfvars
```
